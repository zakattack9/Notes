JavaScript
-to define a new variable, use the keyword var
-using an equal sign with var sets a value for it

Data Types:
-string: exact value; must be in quotes
-number: for numbers
-boolean: true (1) or false (0)
-null: nothing, empty
-undefined: variable doesn't exist

Arrays:
-zero-based index storage, used in between brackets
-can store any multiple types of data inside it
-each value separated by comma, first value is 0 and then increases from there on

Javascript Operators:
-for comparason and logic;
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
== equality
=== strict equality
!= inequality
!== strict inequality
&& logical AND
|| logical OR
----------------------------
= is for assignment
== and === are for comparing equality

Functions:
-defines a block statement to execute
-when it is invoked, it executes the function

Arguments and Parameters:
-parameter defined to live within scope of function
-scope is the range in JavaScript within function

Objects:
-collection of key value pairs, defined by {}
-key valued pairs seperated by commas
-to access properties use dot notation

Console Log:
-written as console.log()
-anything within the parenthesis is displayed on screen
-variable names can also be put within the () too
-console.log() determines what is shown on screen
-when using variable names in console log, they do not need quotes (strings)
-can put functions within (), ex. 12-2 will be displayed as 10 on screen; uses PEMDAS

Side Note on JavaScript loops

var people = ["John", "Jim", "Jill"];

for(var i = 0; i < people.length; i++){
  console.log("I am " + people[i]);
}

This Java Loop will give an out put of all the people's names because it looped each of the 
variables from the array. ALso since it is i < people.legnth, it starts at the left at runs 
through all the options going to the right. If it was i > people.legnth, it would start at the 
last variable of the array and continue on above it, therefore, this function would have no output.
