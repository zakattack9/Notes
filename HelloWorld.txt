MEDIA QUERIES
- tells your design in CSS to change according to a certain condition
- break points in CSS that tell your app to change according to screensize
- for example, if screen size shrinks below 500px, the background-color will automatically change blue
- @media <--command in CSS for media query
- usually uses a guidline between 600px and 650px

EM
- adjusts to the size of its parent
- default font-size in css is 16px
- good for responsive design because everything will adjust to a smaller or larger size
- if a child is set at .5em and its parent size is 16px, than .5em is actually 10px (16 x .5) = 10px
- to convert px to em multiply it by 1.5
